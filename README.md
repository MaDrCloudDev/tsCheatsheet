# [typeScriptCheatsheet](https://tscheatsheet.vercel.app)

Coming from a self-taught, web-based background, the official TypeScript documentation doesn't feel digestible to me. Instead, I prefer something a litte more concise. This is my personal TypeScript cheatsheet. It is inspired **Heavily** by the [W3School's TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/). I'm making it public in case anyone else can make use of it.
