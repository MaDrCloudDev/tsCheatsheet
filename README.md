# [typeScriptCheatsheet](https://tscheatsheet.vercel.app)

The official TypeScript documentation doesn't feel digestible to me. I prefer something a litte more concise. This is my personal TypeScript cheatsheet. It's influenced by the [W3School's TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/), which I recommend everyone check out, but which is a little too dense to be used as a quick cheatsheet. I'm making this public in case anyone else can make use of it.
