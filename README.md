# typeScriptCheatsheet

Coming from a self-taught, web-based background, the official TypeScript documentation doesn't feel digestible to me. Instead, I prefer something a litte more concise. This is my personal TypeScript cheatsheet. It is inspired **Heavily** by the [W3School's TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/). I'm making it public in case anyone else can make use of it.

```
// after you install ts-node globally

sudo npm install -g ts-node

// cd to this project, npm install and
// you can run ts files from your terminal using ts-node the same way you'd use the node shell

ts-node functions.ts
```
