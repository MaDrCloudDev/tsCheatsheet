title: Keyof
description: TypeScript Keyof.
---

the `keyof` keyword is utilized to extract the type of keys from an object type. When applied to an object type that has explicit keys, `keyof` generates a union type encompassing those keys.

```ts copy
interface Employee {
	name: string;
	age: number;
}

function printEmployeeProperty(employee: Employee, property: keyof Employee) {
	console.log(
		`Printing employee property ${property}: "${employee[property]}"`
	);
}
// `keyof Employee` here creates a union type of "name" and "age",
// other strings will not be allowed
let employee = {
	name: 'Matt',
	age: 30,
};
printEmployeeProperty(employee, 'name'); // Printing employee
// property name: "Matt"
```

## `keyof` using index signatures

the `keyof` keyword can also be employed with index signatures to extract the type of indexes.

```ts copy
type StringMap = { [key: string]: unknown };
// Here, `keyof StringMap` resolves to a `string`
function createStringPair(property: keyof StringMap, value: string): StringMap {
	return { [property]: value };
}
```
