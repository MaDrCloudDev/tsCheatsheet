# Classes

## Member Types

```ts copy
class Pet {
	name: string; // property.
}

const pet = new Pet();
pet.name = 'Mittens';

console.log(pet); // returns Pet { name: 'Mittens' }.
```

## Member - Visibility

Member properties can be public, private, or protected.

- Public members are accessible from anywhere (default).
- Private members are only accessible from within the class.
- Protected members are accessible from within the class and from classes that extend from the class.

```ts copy
class Pet {
	private name: string;

	public constructor(name: string) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public getName(): string {
		return this.name;
	}
}

const pet = new Pet('Snuggles');

console.log(pet.getName()); // since pet.name is private,
// it isn't accessible outside the class.
```

## Parameter Properties

In TypeScript, you can conveniently define class members in the constructor by adding visibility modifiers to the constructor parameters. This allows you to automatically create and initialize class properties with a concise syntax.

```ts copy
class Pet {
	public constructor(private name: string) {}
	// name is a private member variable
	public getName(): string {
		return this.name;
	}
}

const pet = new Pet('Snowball');
console.log(pet.getName()); // logs 'Snowball'
```

## Readonly

Prevents class members from being changed.

```ts copy
class Pet {
	private readonly name: string;

	public constructor(name: string) {
		// name cannot be changed after definition,
		// which must be at it's declaration or in the constructor.
		this.name = name;
	}

	public getName(): string {
		return this.name;
	}
}

const pet = new Pet('Jingles');
console.log(pet.getName());
```

## Inheritance - implements

The implements key word is used to indicate that a class implements an interface to define the type a class must conform to.

```ts copy
interface Shape {
	getArea: () => number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
	public constructor(
		protected readonly width: number,
		protected readonly height: number
	) {}

	public getArea(): number {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}
}

const ourRectangle = new Rectangle(11, 22);

console.log(ourRectangle.getArea());
```

Classes can implement multiple interfaces.

## Inheritance - extends (extends Rectangle above)

A class can extend another class to inherit its members. A class can only extend one other class.

```ts copy
interface Shape {
	getArea: () => number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
	public constructor(
		protected readonly width: number,
		protected readonly height: number
	) {}

	public getArea(): number {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
	public constructor(width: number) {
		super(width, width);
	}
	// inherited from Rectangle.
}

const ourSquare = new Square(22);

console.log(ourSquare.getArea());
```

## Override

When you use a class to extend another, you can override methods from the parent class by redefining them in the child class. You can also override properties.

```ts copy
interface Shape {
	getArea: () => number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
	// using protected for these members allows access from classes that extend from this class, such as Square
	public constructor(
		protected readonly width: number,
		protected readonly height: number
	) {}

	public getArea(): number {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}

	public toString(): string {
		return `Rectangle[width=${this.width}, height=${this.height}]`;
	}
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
	public constructor(width: number) {
		super(width, width);
	}

	// Replaces earlier toString from Rectangle
	public override toString(): string {
		return `Square[width=${this.width}]`;
	}
}

const ourSquare = new Square(22);

console.log(ourSquare.toString());
```

Override keyword is optional, but it's good practice to use it.

## Abstract Classes

Can be used as a base for other classes, without having to implement or use all that classes members.

```ts copy
abstract class Polygon {
	public abstract getArea(): number;

	public toString(): string {
		return `Polygon[area=${this.getArea()}]`;
	}
}

class Rectangle extends Polygon {
	public constructor(
		protected readonly width: number,
		protected readonly height: number
	) {
		super();
	}

	public getArea(): number {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}
}

const ourRectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);

console.log(ourRectangle.getArea());
```
