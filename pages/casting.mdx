## Casting Types

```ts copy
let a: unknown = 'Hello World!';
console.log((a as string).length);

// Casting doesn't really change type, it just tells
// the compiler to treat it as a different type
let a2: unknown = 3;
console.log((a2 as string).length); // logs undefined
// because numbers don't have a length
```

## TypeScript typechecks casts

```ts copy
console.log((3 as string).length); // Error: Conversion
// of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake
// because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the
// other. If this was intentional, convert the expression
// to 'unknown' first.
```

## Casting using &lt;&gt;; doesn't work in TSX

```ts copy
let a3: unknown = 'Hello World!';
console.log((<string>a).length);
```

## Forced casting

```ts copy
let a4 = 'Hello World!';
console.log((a4 as unknown as number).length); // a is not
// actually a number so returns undefined
```
