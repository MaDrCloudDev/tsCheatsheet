## Casting Types

Casting overrides the variable type, which you may want to do when you know more about the type than the compiler does.

## Casting using as

```ts copy
let a: unknown = 'Hello World!';

console.log(a.length);
// Property 'length' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
console.log((a as string).length); // Works because now
// the compiler sees it as a string.
```

An example that might make more sense.

```ts copy
let a: unknown = 'Hello World!';

function any() {
	let aAsAny = a as any;
	console.log(a.length); // returns error TS2339: Property
	// 'length' does not exist on type 'unknown' because
	// .length doesn't exist on unknown.
	console.log(aAsAny.length); // returns 12 because we've
	// cast a to any, so we can use .length, treating it like
	// it were a string.
}

any(); // function call
```

Casting doesn't really change type, it tells the compiler to treat it as a different type.

```ts copy
let a: unknown = 3;

console.log((a as string).length); // logs undefined
// because numbers don't have a length.
```

## TypeScript Typechecks Casts

```ts copy
console.log((3 as string).length); // Error: Conversion
// of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake
// because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the
// other. If this was intentional, convert the expression
// to 'unknown' first.
```

## Casting using &lt;&gt;

_Note:_ doesn't work in TSX.

```ts copy
let a: unknown = 'Hello World!';

console.log((<string>a).length); // Works.
```

## Forced casting

You can force cast to any type by casting to unknown, then to the type you want. This will override any errors thrown by casting.

```ts copy
let a = 'Hello World!';
// prettier-ignore
console.log(((a as unknown) as number).length); // a is not
// really a number so returns undefined.
```
