# typeScriptCheatsheet

Coming from a self-taught, web-based background, the official TypeScript documentation doesn't feel digestible to me. Instead, I prefer something a litte more concise. This is my personal TypeScript cheatsheet. It is influenced **Heavily** by the [W3School's TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/), which I recommend everyone check out, but it's a little too dense to be used as a quick cheatsheet. I'm making this public in case anyone else can make use of it.

My original code-only version [is here.](https://github.com/madrclouddev/typeScriptBasics)
